WeRateDogs Data Wrangling Analysis And Visualization Udacity Scholarship

The project II WeRateDogs, a twitter account which has 9.3 million followers across the world contains three datasets namely twitter-archive-enhanced.csv, image_predictions.tsv and tweet_json.txt which we have to programmatically download from three different sources. Two from website URLs and the last one requires the learner to sign up for twitter developer account to collect additional tweet through twitter API. The objective of this project is to challenge the learner to wrangle the three datasets and to combine all the three clean datasets into a twitter master archive by providing at least four insights and two visualizations. In this the following 12 visualizations were explored:<br>
• Visualizing the distribution of dog category based on the favorite tweet count by their
users on twitter<br>
• Visualizing the distribution of dog category based on the retweet count by their users
on twitter<br>
• Visualizing the most used devices by WeRateDogs users<br>
• Visualizing the most common name of dog<br>
• Line plot of like and retweet by twitter users on WeRateDogs account<br>
• Visualizing 20 dogs breed P2 predicted by twitter user on WeRateDogs<br>
• Visualizing 20 dogs breed P3 predicted by twitter user on WeRateDogs<br>
• Visualizing the dog category with the highest rating score<br>
• Visualizing the dog category with maximum favorite count<br>
• Visualizing the dog category with minimum retweet count<br>
• Visualizing Total Tweets made by WeRateDogs per month<br>
• Visualizing some of the dog names in image prediction p1<br>
